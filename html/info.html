                <h2> What is a Front-end Developer?</h2>
                <span class="aciqlama" style="opacity: 0.6;">HTML, CSS, JavaScript</span>
                <p>
                    Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user interface of a website, through
                    the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website. <br>
                    <b>HyperText Markup Language</b><br>
                    HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the backbone of any website development process, without which a
                    web page does not exist. Hypertext means that text has links, termed hyperlinks, embedded in it.
                    When a user clicks on a word or a phrase that has a hyperlink, it will bring another web-page. A
                    markup language indicates text can be turned into images, tables, links, and other representations.
                    It is the HTML code that provides an overall framework of how the site will look. HTML was developed
                    by Tim Berners-Lee. The latest version of HTML is called HTML5 and was published on October 28, 2014
                    by the W3C recommendation. This version contains new and efficient ways of handling elements such as
                    video and audio files. <br>
                    <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b><br>
                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) controls the presentation aspect of the site and allows your site to
                    have its own unique look. It does this by maintaining style sheets that sit on top of other style
                    rules and are triggered based on other inputs, such as device screen size and resolution. The CSS
                    can be added externally, internally, or embedded in the HTML tags. <br>
                    <b>JavaScript</b><br>
                    JavaScript is an event-based imperative programming language (as opposed to HTML's declarative
                    language model) that is used to transform a static HTML page into a dynamic interface. JavaScript
                    code can use the Document Object Model (DOM), provided by the HTML standard, to manipulate a web
                    page in response to events, like user input.
                    Using a technique called AJAX, JavaScript code can also actively retrieve content from the web
                    (independent of the original HTML page retrieval), and also react to server-side events as well,
                    adding a truly dynamic nature to the web page experience. <br>
                    <b>WebAssembly</b><br>
                    WebAssembly, supported by all the major browsers (i.e. from the major vendors Google, Apple, Mozilla
                    and Microsoft), is the only alternative to JavaScript for running code in web browsers (without the
                    help of plug-ins, such as Flash, Java or Silverlight; all being discontinued, as browsers are
                    dropping plug-in support). Prior to its adoption, there was asm.js (a subset of JavaScript; and thus
                    strictly works in all browsers), that's also used as a compiler target with efficient support in
                    browsers such as Internet Explorer 11; and for such browsers that do not support WebAssembly
                    directly, it can be compiled to asm.js and those browsers supported that way. Generally speaking
                    programmers do not program in WebAssembly (or asm.js) directly, but use languages such as Rust, C or
                    C++ or in theory any language, that compile to it.

                <span class="aciqlama" style="opacity: 0.6;">C++,Python,C#</span>
                <p>
                    Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can’t
                    see on a website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases,
                    back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers. They use code
                    that helps browsers communicate with databases, store, understand, and delete data.

                    On a team, back-end developers collaborate with front-end developers, product managers, principal
                    architects, and website testers to build the structure of a website or mobile app. Back-end
                    developers must be familiar with many kinds of tools and frameworks, including languages such as
                    Python, Java, and Ruby. They make sure the back-end performs quickly and responsively to front-end
                    user requests.

                <p>
                    Full stack development refers to the end-to-end application software development, including the
                    front end and back end. The front end consists of the user interface, and the back end takes care of
                    the business logic and application workflows.
                    Consider a retail website. Users can browse or purchase specific items, delete or add items in cart,
                    change their profile, and do many other things. All these actions require a front-end user interface
                    (UI), as well as some business logic, written in the back-end. <br>
                    -The website UI can be built using various, front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript. <br>
                    -The back end is written in programming languages like Java or Python. Further, a good web
                    application would need scalability, event handling, and routing, which are usually handled by
                    libraries and frameworks like SpringBoot or Django. <br>
                    -The back end also consists of logic that can connect the application to other services and
                    databases. For example, all the user and transaction data is stored in a database through specific
                    drivers handled on the back end.

                <span class="aciqlama" style="opacity: 0.6;">HTML, CSS, JavaScript</span>
                <p>
                    Information security, sometimes shortened to InfoSec, is the practice of protecting information
                    by mitigating information risks. It is part of information risk management. It typically
                    involves preventing or reducing the probability of unauthorized/inappropriate access to data, or the
                    unlawful use, disclosure, disruption, deletion, corruption, modification, inspection, recording, or
                    devaluation of information. It also involves actions intended to reduce the adverse impacts of
                    such incidents. Protected information may take any form, e.g. electronic or physical, tangible (e.g.
                    paperwork) or intangible (e.g. knowledge). Information security's primary focus is the
                    balanced protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data (also known as the
                    CIA triad) while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation, all without hampering
                    organization productivity. This is largely achieved through a structured risk management process
                    that involves: <br>

                    -identifying information and related assets, plus potential threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts;
                    <br>
                    -evaluating the risks <br>
                    -deciding how to address or treat the risks i.e. to avoid, mitigate, share or accept them <br>
                    -where risk mitigation is required, selecting or designing appropriate security controls and
                    implementing them <br>
                    -monitoring the activities, making adjustments as necessary to address any issues, changes and
                    improvement opportunities <br>
                    To standardize this discipline, academics and professionals collaborate to offer guidance, policies,
                    and industry standards on password, antivirus software, firewall, encryption software, legal
                    liability, security awareness and training, and so forth. This standardization may be further
                    driven by a wide variety of laws and regulations that affect how data is accessed, processed,
                    stored, transferred and destroyed. However, the implementation of any standards and guidance
                    within an entity may have limited effect if a culture of continual improvement isn't adopted.
